# Python-Scripting-Portfolio
This is a collection of small-medium python projects I've worked on throughout the App Brewery's 100 Days of Code Bootcamp, as well as on my own time. All of the included projects are at least significantly modified by me in some way, if not just my own work. Enjoy!:)

APIs, GUIs, email & notification bots, data exploration, games, desktop tools, etc.
