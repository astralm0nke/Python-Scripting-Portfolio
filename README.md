# Python-Scripting-Portfolio
This is a collection of small-medium python projects I've worked on throughout the App Brewery Bootcamp, as well as on my own time. All of the included projects are at least modified or added onto by me in some way, if not just my own work. Enjoy!:)

APIs, GUIs, email bots, notification bots, price watchers, games, desktop tools, etc.
